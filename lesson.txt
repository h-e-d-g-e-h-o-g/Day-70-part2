In this lesson, we will learn how to prevent certain files to be committed into local or remote repository.
The files that need to be prevented from committed into local or remote repo are:-
(1) The files in which important info are stored such as password, api key etc.
(2) The files that deals with local settings or user preferences such as .DS_STORE, these kind of files do not add any value.
They store things like how you want your file icons to be arranged inside a project folder and etc. 
NOTE:- To remove files from staging area, we use command "git rm --cached -r ."
-r represents recursive here, and "." represents all the files that are in staging area.
Now, talking about ".gitignore", in order to ignore files from being committed and added into the repository.
We need to specify them in the .gitignore file.

NOTE:- you can also use another way, such as if you can use "*.txt" to specify all the files with txt extension.
or "*.log" to specify all the files with log extension.

If you go to "github.com" and get to the repository named "gitignore".
It is a repository that has the collection of gitignore templates for different purposes.
These templates would have included the name of the files that need to be ignored to be committed.
There would be a python folder where files extension are mentioned of those files that should be ignored.
